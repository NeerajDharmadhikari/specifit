As individuals that are aware of the benefits of being healthy and the consequences of not, our team is thoroughly familiar with the struggles of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. From the plethora of artifacts that contribute to health, such as diet, sleep, and activity level, it can become easy to overlook any single category of one’s wellness. We believe that diet is something that is often neglected. Our team would like to offer an easy way of improving diet to anyone who is looking to lead a healthier lifestyle.

Our app is designed for any person looking to improve their diet whenever eating at a restaurant. We put an emphasis on helping users keep a log of their past meals. Specifit will then use the nutritional contents of these past meals as well as the user’s current location to make a recommendation of where and what they should eat. The user will be presented with a selection of restaurants to choose from, and then a ranked personalized list of suggested meals from healthiest to unhealthiest from the chosen restaurant. The meals on this list will advise the user on how to meet the calorie and nutritional content requirements in order to reach their specified goal weight. 

Every user will be asked to register and make an account before they can use the application, and first time the account is created, the user will be asked to enter their weight, height, age, gender, level of physical activity, and a desired weekly weight change. A rough mock-up of the very start of the application has been provided.

Our objective is to help our users obtain a better understanding of the contents of their diet and how changes to the number of calories they eat results in a change in their weight. We believe that our app will be chosen over similar products because of our simplicity and ease of use. Our app will aim to answer the question “what should I eat” quickly and efficiently. The user will not be forced to spend unnecessary time looking for a meal; it will be presented to them.
