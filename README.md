Personal Food Recommender System


● Specifit
Our group has come to the realization that as students at UCI, we have a hard time finding
restaurants nearby to eat at that fit our specific diets. We are going to make an app that
searches for dishes at restaurants that fit the user’s dietary regimen.

● Goal of the System
Our primary goal is to help the stereotypical college demographic or older people (18+)
who are on diets. The people who would use this app would be unable to cook or would
not have access to a kitchen and are forced/want to eat at restaurants. Our system will
ultimately simplify the restaurant choosing process by analyzing dishes at these
restaurants and making a recommendation. If the user is unsure about which diet to follow,
we will also recommend a diet based on age, activity level, and (optionally) blood type.
Our users will be looking for suggestions on where and what to eat. They will expect to
see nutritional information as well as distance and price of any dishes and restaurants we
suggest.
We will get location and activity data from the user’s phone using GPS and pedometer.
The user will be responsible for adding weight, age, and blood type information. Data
pertaining to restaurants will be found using Yelp and web crawling restaurant websites.
